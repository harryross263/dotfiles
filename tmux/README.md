dotfiles
========
This is a selection of my dotfiles. I personally clone this repo into `~/.dotfiles`, then symlink things into `~`.

This contains some personal preferences but is not linked to a particular computer.

I do not like the new bash sessions as it does not work well with tmux. To disable them, simply run `touch ~/.bash_session_disable`.

## Warnings
Do *not* install Brewfile.complete; it is a list of everything I had installed with homebrew on my old harddrive. It should not all be reinstalled. See Brewfile and Brewfile.alt.

Brewfile and Brewfile.alt are intended for the `brew bundle` command.
